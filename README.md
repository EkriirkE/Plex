Plex Media Server Scripts

Stop the plexmediaserver service and back up the database files before making modifications.

While in the plexmediaserver folder, where the program `Plex SQLite` lives....

### update.sh
Check for, and download, the most recent version of aacrch64 plexmediaserver.  
Automatically installs if a new version is downloaded, and cleans up prior downloads.  If you remove the most recent .deb the script will always dowload and install regrless of version.  
Note that I do not use Debian, but `dpkg` is available on ArchLinuxARM and PMS has always worked great on it.

### datemedia.py
Update the "Date Added" in Plex to match the modification date of the source media - only if it is older.  
Sometimes reorganizing your media folders causes Plex to detect (old) media as a new addition and sort it accordingly.  I don't like old media showing up in recommended as "new".  
If the file is newer that the original added date and it get updated, the best you can with this script is to "touch" the media file(s) with the expected dates before running this script.  
Protip:  An in-place file replacement is usually ignored by Plex, so avoid moving or renaming old media if replacing it with a better copy (of the exact same name and extension).  

### itunes2plex.py
Extract song ratings, play counts, and last play date from iTunes Library.xml and insert/sync it with Plex.
Either filter a PlexAcctName to apply the stats to a single profile, or blank for all profiles in your account.
Outputs SQLite commands to STDOUT, redirect>to a file and import using Plex SQLite

### Manual SQL stuff

Enter the Plex SQL Environment via
```shell
./Plex\ SQLite "Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db"
```

#### Move library location, and its contents, from `/media/OldPath` to `/media/NewLocation`
```sql
-- Library location
UPDATE section_locations SET root_path='/media/NewLocation' WHERE root_path='/media/OldPath';
-- Library contents' locations
UPDATE media_parts SET file=REPLACE(file,'/media/OldPath/','/media/NewLocation/') WHERE file LIKE '/media/OldPath/%';
```
